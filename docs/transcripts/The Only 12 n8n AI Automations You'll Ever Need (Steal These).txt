👋  ABOUT ME
Hey everyone, my name is Jono. I run a 7-figure service business that offers DJ, photo, video services (#1 largest in Canada), and spent years figuring out how to automate every part of it (and hired the roles that I couldn't). Conservatively, I used to work 80+ hours per week, before sunrise till long after sunset; missing gatherings, family events and everything in between. Through automation though, I was able to replace my job. My goal is to help share what worked for me, in a dream of helping others find true success with their passion.

Intro
0:00
what's going on guys today we're talking
0:01
about 12 gamechanging NAND automations
0:04
that I think you're absolutely going to
0:05
love Most of these I use every single
0:07
day With that being said just before we
0:09
dive into showcasing all of these I just
0:11
want to let you know every single one of
0:13
the blueprints are going to be down
0:14
below in the description for free You're
0:16
going to see links to other videos In
0:17
those videos you'll see the step-by-step
0:19
tutorial as well as the blueprints to
0:22
those systems Now all of these combined
0:25
save me hours and hours and hours every
0:28
single week I'm sure they can have the
0:30
same effect on you as well And I'm
0:31
really excited to share this content
0:33
with you Let's dive into it right now
Clean your inbox automatically
0:36
First one is simple It's actually
0:39
automating the process of cleaning up
0:41
your Gmail inbox So if you're like me
0:44
you're probably like drowning inside
0:47
Gmails every single day And one of the
0:50
things is is like I just love the idea
0:52
of organizing my inbox by essentially
0:55
labeling them And so that's exactly what
0:57
this automation does when you receive an
0:59
email through Gmail it's going to
1:01
automatically classify that email of one
1:04
of many categories And the categories
1:06
are the labels over here So like I have
1:07
like calendar and recruitment and school
1:10
and um all these other kind of labels
1:12
And so what happens is when emails come
1:15
in they're automatically labeled
1:16
Sometimes I create draft responses to
1:19
them So if we kind of come back into
1:21
this inbox here you can see down here
1:23
there's a draft email Sometimes I
1:25
automatically send emails back Sometimes
1:27
I forward off emails to my accountant so
1:30
on and so forth And sometimes when you
1:32
get those like annoying uh e-commerce
1:34
emails on your birthday being like
1:36
"Happy birthday Would you like to spend
1:37
an extra $20 on stuff you don't need?"
1:39
You can also either delete those or you
1:42
can just mark them as red which is
1:44
really cool So saves a ton of time Now
1:47
you'll notice too that it also doesn't
1:48
like kind of remove everything from the
1:50
common inbox You can do that you could
1:52
put them into the the the given labels
1:55
but I actually like having like a
1:56
primary inbox um where everything comes
1:58
in so I can see it in one feed The next
Speed-to-lead workflow
2:00
automation that I want to talk about is
2:02
something that um is probably one of the
2:05
highest impact automations that you
2:07
could possibly build which is also
2:08
consequently like one of the easiest
2:10
freaking things you could possibly build
2:11
on N So this is a speedtole workflow If
2:14
you run a service-based business so take
2:16
for example my business here If you run
2:18
a service-based business like this
2:20
people are going to inquire about your
2:22
products or services They're going to
2:23
fill out their first name and their last
2:25
name and all these other details and
2:26
then they're going to click a button
2:28
saying you know let's talk and you've
2:30
got a lead Right now the thing is is
2:32
that if you call that person within 60
2:34
seconds you increase your conversion
2:36
rate by up to
2:38
391% If you wait 24 hours you pretty
2:41
much lose all of that advantage You
2:43
could make four times as much money just
2:45
by calling faster by doing no extra work
2:48
Let me show you how this works I have
2:50
this particular form in front of me I'm
2:52
going to first of all start this
2:54
workflow and wait for a response and
2:55
then submit a quote form And in a matter
2:57
of a couple seconds this workflow is
2:59
going to start It's going to activate
3:01
the trigger add that client into our CRM
3:03
start a call and I'm also going to get a
3:06
message notifying me Here's the call
3:08
coming in Here's
3:11
Gandalf
3:14
Here's the message from the call Just
3:16
inquired about your services Please
3:19
press any key on the keypad to connect
3:21
into a and I could connect into the call
3:24
with the client Right now I'm the sales
3:25
rep by clicking any key on the keypad
3:28
And now I'd call the client which you
3:30
can see on my phone here I'm also call
3:32
calling myself This is just an example
3:33
where I'm the client and I'm also the
3:35
sales rep But yeah that's how fast it
3:38
can be like literally 15 seconds you can
3:40
like be the first person to call that
3:43
person and more than 50% of sales goes
3:45
to the first uh company that actually
3:47
calls the client The reason why you
3:48
heard Gandalf there was just because I
3:50
got this notification right here where
3:52
um essentially I was notifying myself of
3:55
a lead coming through I don't know if
3:57
you can see my phone there but I have a
3:58
lead just with all the information of
4:00
this particular client This is another
4:02
way around it where if you don't want to
4:04
call yourself immediately you could just
4:05
send yourself a text message and then
4:07
you call that lead literally in the span
4:08
of like 15 seconds on the back end This
4:11
is what it looks like to call them We're
4:13
sending data to um GoHighle and then
4:16
we're automatically calling people in a
4:18
matter of 10 seconds Go High Level cost
4:20
$97 a month It's quite expensive but in
4:22
my community I offer this on $1 plans I
4:25
wish I could actually give it away for
4:26
free but the minimum to um automatically
4:29
set it up and install uh install this
4:31
for people was $1 So that's kind of what
4:33
it is If you guys want that you can join
4:34
my community The next thing here is this
Scrape Google Maps data
4:37
Google Maps scraper So if you guys are
4:40
in the business of having to generate
4:41
leads sell those leads or if you're just
4:44
you know that's the lifeblood of your
4:45
business which is most service- based
4:47
businesses I'm sure you'll love this one
4:48
as well So this one scrapes Google Maps
4:50
listings So for example take this Maybe
4:54
you need to reach out to Toronto
4:56
landscapers And in the good old days
4:58
you'd have to go through all of these
4:59
listings one by one by one And I don't
5:02
think there's a single like human soul
5:04
on this planet that would enjoy the
5:06
process of going through this one by one
5:08
by one It would be slightly soul
5:10
crushing I think to say the least But
5:12
with an automation like this we can
5:14
schedule it So every single day it goes
5:16
through scrapes those um those those
5:18
leads off of Google Maps It even grabs
5:21
things like their email address by
5:23
actually going a step further not just
5:25
the listing here but also to the website
5:28
page because they have the website here
5:30
They don't have emails listed And then
5:32
it adds these leads over to this Google
5:35
uh sheet right here You could take it a
5:36
step further connect it into Instantly
5:38
which is a cold email outreach platform
5:40
which means that you could scrape
5:42
hundreds or even thousands of leads
5:44
instantly without doing any work pretty
5:46
much once it's set up And then you could
5:48
email these people as well You could
5:50
even throw in AI and customize and
5:52
personalize the emails that you're
5:54
sending out Um if you guys want access
5:56
to that go highlevel um account you can
5:58
join my school community It's going to
6:00
be in the description down below here
6:01
Funny thing is is it's actually cheaper
6:03
than signing up for a go highle account
6:05
in general All of these blueprints plus
6:07
so many more um are going to be in this
6:09
community as well as weekly calls If you
6:11
guys are ever looking for like tech
6:13
support you can jump on our calls or
6:14
live workshops We build things out
6:16
together as well as business calls as
6:19
well The primary objective of this is
6:21
two paths People that want to earn money
6:23
using AI and automation so selling it
6:25
And the second one is for operators of
6:27
businesses who want to automate all of
6:29
the work they're currently doing
6:30
manually right now Moving on the next
Job seeker automation
6:32
workflow is for job seekers So if you're
6:35
out there you're looking for new jobs
6:37
you know how big of a pain in the ass it
6:39
is There's nothing that sucks more than
6:41
having to go through hundreds or even
6:43
thousands of job listings just to find
6:45
the right ones And then once you find
6:47
the right one then you have to apply to
6:48
them create cover letters It's a
6:50
nightmare I don't think anyone likes
6:51
doing that With this automation
6:54
essentially how this works is we
6:55
schedule it so that every single day you
6:57
can search through job boards like
7:00
LinkedIn And you can find the right
7:02
positions you're looking for In this
7:04
example we're using SEO and we're using
7:06
the location Canada And so it's going to
7:08
pull in all of these job listings here
7:10
via an RSS feed that we created This is
7:13
a custom RSS feed via RSS.app app and
7:16
then we're essentially feeding it into
7:18
this workflow Now how this works is we
7:20
generate tons of information about the
7:22
job We actually rate the job on a 1 to5
7:25
scale um so that you can prioritize the
7:27
ones that you actually like and then we
7:30
create cover letters that are customized
7:32
to that job and then post it into a
7:34
Google sheet here so that you can focus
7:36
on applying to the highest rated jobs
7:38
with a custom cover letter How this
7:41
practically works is we mirror well we
7:44
we take a snapshot of your uh your
7:46
resume and then compare it to the job
7:48
and then we just see hey on a on certain
7:50
categories like is this you know a good
7:53
fit for you and if so then here's a
7:56
cover letter all that kind of stuff So
7:57
obviously saves a ton of time not only
7:59
in searching for these jobs but then
8:01
also in the application process of
8:02
generating the cover letters which is
8:04
super nice The next one is this chatgbt
Connect ChatGPT with n8n
8:07
n connection I think this is so freaking
8:09
cool Essentially you can connect chat
8:11
GBT into NADN And so instead of actually
8:15
interacting with chat GBT you can do
8:18
this straight or instead of going into
8:20
NAD you can literally just do this all
8:23
from within CHAGBT You could also do
8:25
this in claude as well in case you guys
8:27
want to use that So both options are
8:29
available And I have blueprints on both
8:31
of these but essentially in Chad GBT you
8:34
need you do need to be on a plus plan So
8:36
take this example Let's say I uploaded a
8:39
receipt and then I said "Can you please
8:40
process this receipt?" And I say "Please
8:42
here to chat GBT just because I'm
8:44
Canadian and there's no other reason to
8:45
that for that." And then it essentially
8:48
asks for my permission It will take out
8:50
all of the line items here from that
8:52
receipt And then it'll process that and
8:54
add it into this Google sheet right here
8:56
So take the total the tax the quantity
8:58
the description title everything And
9:01
it's really nice cuz it's going line
9:02
item by line item through that receipt
9:05
as well And so obviously super cool
AI agent to manage your life
9:07
stuff Next one is this AI agent that
9:10
could literally manage your entire life
9:13
This is just like a couple examples of
9:15
things that it could do So for example
9:17
it could make calls on your behalf It
9:19
could manage your calendar It could
9:22
manage your Gmail It could manage your
9:24
social media posting It could manage
9:25
your to-do list on Air Table It could
9:27
also manage document parsing like
9:30
receipts your invoices all that kind of
9:32
stuff So super cool Here's just one
9:34
example with the document parsing here
9:36
We could or in this document we could
9:38
actually it's not parsing as much as is
9:40
sending off receipt or invoices to
9:42
people So say you have a meeting with a
9:44
client goes well you want to send off a
9:46
receipt or sorry an invoice to them All
9:49
you have to do is you just have to
9:51
message your assistant inside something
9:53
like telegram which is going to fire off
9:55
this bot to go down the document sub
9:57
agent Essentially from there you can
9:59
send off this contract straight to their
10:01
email instantaneously which contains a
10:04
contract in an invoice Now this is just
10:06
like a sample contract as you can see by
10:09
saying logo here Probably wouldn't want
10:11
to send that off to a client but uh yeah
10:13
it's super cool to set up super easy as
10:15
well and super powerful The this is an
10:18
example of like one of the sub agents So
10:20
this main AI agent has multiple sub AI
10:24
agents connected into it This is an
10:27
example of that And so you could ask it
10:29
hey can you create a calendar event for
10:31
me at 11:00 a.m tomorrow for coffee and
10:33
it'll go ahead and just do that So you
10:35
can have like sub agent or AI agent
10:39
inception where there's like stacks of
10:40
AI agents managing each other which is
10:42
really really cool And that's going to
10:43
be in the description down below for
10:44
free as well You could also have another
10:47
sub agent uh managing your air table So
10:50
for example you could be like "Hey
10:51
remind me tomorrow or tonight to cook
10:53
dinner at 5:00 p.m." And it'll add that
10:55
to your to-do list Assign yourself and
10:57
assign a priority to that as well The
Voice AI for calls
11:00
next thing that I want to talk about
11:01
here is you can actually do voice AI
11:04
calling This could be outbound calling
11:06
This could be inbound calling Um there's
11:08
so many options in this particular
11:10
workflow What you can do is you could be
11:11
like "Hey find me like five hairdressers
11:14
in Toronto." So it'll go scrape those
11:17
hairdressers from Google Maps and then
11:19
you can call your favorite one to book
11:20
an appointment This is kind of like just
11:22
a demo of how the software works AI
11:25
calling just as a disclaimer isn't
11:26
perfect uh at the time of this recording
11:29
Could very well be is obviously going to
11:31
get way better in the future but just
11:33
kind of take it with a grain of salt but
11:34
essentially this is a demo of how this
11:36
works So this is going to be an example
11:38
of what that voice AI agent sounds like
11:41
I'm just going to go ahead and pick this
11:42
up
11:45
Hello
11:47
Hello I'd like to book a dinner
11:48
reservation tonight Okay perfect At what
11:51
time great Anytime between 5:00 p.m and
11:55
8:00 p.m would be great Do you have a
11:57
table by the window available if not any
11:59
spot within Yep we have a window table
12:02
available at 6:30 Does that work for you
12:06
that works perfectly Thank you so much
12:09
Awesome Can I get a name
12:12
yes The reservation is for Jono Thank
12:14
you Okay I'll see you then Thanks very
12:16
much Bye-bye And so obviously you know
12:20
not out of this world perfect yet but
12:22
for the year 2025 I think that's really
12:24
freaking cool Obviously it's only going
12:27
to get better as time goes on And so
12:29
that's just an example of how you can
Add a custom chatbot to your site
12:31
use an AI agent The next thing that I
12:33
want to talk about here and by the way
12:34
this is powered by Vappy up here The
12:37
next thing we're going to talk about is
12:38
adding a custom chatbot onto your
12:40
website Like you can see here I actually
12:42
had just just moved my face over because
12:45
my face was definitely in the way of
12:47
this And so essentially we have this
12:49
chatbot Okay this is like adding chatbt
12:52
to your website So you can have an LLM
12:53
on your website interacting with your
12:56
particular clients Now it doesn't just
12:58
have to be something where they chat
12:59
back and forth You can add so many
13:01
different tools to this So for example
13:03
you could send your clients an invoice
13:04
So I could say um please as the client I
13:07
could say please send me over an invoice
13:10
And just like how this would work is
13:12
maybe like you'd have like your
13:13
packaging on the website here The client
13:16
sees something they like and they're
13:17
like "Hey okay this is good I want to
13:18
move forward." They ask the chatbot to
13:20
send it over And so I'm going to provide
13:22
my name and then I'm going to provide my
13:26
email address here And then it's going
13:27
to go ahead work its magic send that uh
13:30
over to me And then I can take a look at
13:32
my email see an invoice coming through
13:34
this and then I could go ahead and pay
13:36
and sign all within a matter of a couple
13:39
seconds Now it doesn't just have to send
13:41
over contracts or invoices It could also
13:43
go ahead and schedule calendar uh
13:46
invites between that person and your
13:49
sales rep on your team which is also
13:52
really cool And this is just a couple
13:53
things that it could do The next thing
Extract data from photo invoices → Google Sheets
13:54
that I want to talk about here is a
13:57
invoice generator So actually that's
14:00
probably the worst name that I could
14:01
have come up with because that's not
14:02
what it does at all This parses receipts
14:06
and and specifically those receipts
14:08
could be images or they could be PDF
14:11
files And so the trick here is is that
14:14
we need to take PDFs we need to take
14:16
images and we need to convert those file
14:19
types into text and then we need to
14:21
essentially extract all the line items
14:23
and place it into a Google sheet like
14:26
this This is great if you deal with a
14:28
lot of receipts or invoices A lot of
14:30
tech companies um will just essentially
14:33
send you invoices monthly for your
14:35
subscription right and if you're like me
14:37
and you have that like software creep
14:38
where you just have like a million one
14:40
softwares every single month this is
14:42
great because all of a sudden you can
14:43
just get those emails coming through You
14:44
could attach to something like this and
14:46
then automatically extract it and put it
14:48
into line items here So really really
14:50
freaking cool stuff The next one here is
AI-powered chatbot
14:53
a rag system So this is like um an AI
14:56
chatbot that you train on the history of
14:59
your company This is like the most
15:01
intelligent employee you've ever hired
15:03
Essentially how this works is think
15:04
about like the process of actually
15:06
hiring an employee Firstly you're going
15:09
to onboard them You're going to train
15:11
them on the pricing and the contracts
15:13
the invoices the how you message people
15:15
You're going to train them on the
15:16
standard operating procedures Every
15:18
single thing about your company you're
15:19
going to train that person on And
15:21
similarly you train a rag system on
15:24
essentially the same things So you train
15:26
the the rag system It has information
15:28
about every single possible interaction
15:31
uh that your company's ever had And then
15:33
what happens now is you can set up a
15:35
chatbot where people can message the
15:37
system and it will give that user back
15:40
the most appropriate message the
15:41
question So for example I have this
15:44
contract here This is a contract for DJ
15:47
photo and video services And so I could
15:50
ask it specific questions about this
15:52
chat So I could be like I'm just going
15:53
to refresh this chat What services are
15:57
offered it's going to go ahead and look
16:00
at the memory storage find the
16:02
information about that contract and then
16:04
spit it back out We offer DJ services
16:06
photo services video services You can
16:08
take a look at the contract here and it
16:10
says DJ services oops right here And
16:13
then it says uh photo services as well
16:16
as video services down here So it will
16:18
literally give you custom tailored
16:20
responses back based on the information
16:23
you provide it with So you could train
16:25
this on your entire company and then
16:26
have like a really intelligent bot that
16:28
knows everything about your company
16:30
Really really cool stuff The next thing
Automate recruitment
16:32
here is recruitment And so what I've
16:34
done is I've set up a custom Google
16:36
Sheets dashboard Now this automates the
16:39
entire process of recruitment for me
16:42
Because what ended up happening was like
16:44
I was hiring thousands of people As you
16:46
can see here it's like actually tens of
16:48
thousands of people And um it was
16:50
obviously overwhelming It felt like a
16:52
full-time job doing this So I was like
16:54
hm how can I automate this whole process
16:56
um and here's how it works Essentially
16:59
people come in from Indeed This is one
17:00
of my favorite places to hire from
17:02
People apply to jobs and as soon as they
17:05
apply to jobs I'll automatically um get
17:07
their information and put them onto this
17:10
particular spreadsheet here From there
17:12
we have the entire life cycle stage of
17:16
their um of their recruitment process So
17:18
the first thing is is they actually come
17:20
onto the sheet and then we have to ask
17:21
them onboarding questions Onboarding
17:23
questions are like this We send them off
17:25
a form and we're like "Hey can you tell
17:26
us more about yourself can you provide
17:28
us with a resume can you provide us with
17:30
maybe a portfolio link can you tell us
17:31
how many years you've been doing what
17:32
you've been doing for what's your
17:34
expected salary?" All of that kind of
17:35
stuff And then from there uh once they
17:38
actually submit those questions this
17:40
will be marked as complete And then the
17:43
next thing is is that we actually have
17:44
to screen those people And so that's the
17:46
next step This can be automated too Like
17:48
you could automatically screen their
17:50
resume But for me I just like to quickly
17:52
do a once over just to make sure that
17:53
they're the right fit for the next stage
17:55
which is a test This is where we test
17:58
their skills in whatever uh position
18:00
they're hiring for So for example if
18:03
you're a blog writer write me a couple
18:05
blogs if you're a photo editor edit some
18:07
photos for me That kind of stuff As long
18:08
as they pass the test and it's good to
18:10
go it looks good then we can schedule an
18:12
interview This is all automated Then we
18:13
can have a second interview and so on
18:15
and so forth And so that's a really easy
18:17
way how you can automate a task that or
18:21
a process that takes hours every single
18:22
day You can also automate the
18:24
appointments and all that kind of stuff
18:25
too uh when it comes to hiring people
18:27
because obviously you're going to have
18:28
to do interviews and this is a great way
Custom dashboard in Google Sheets
18:30
to automate that as well Lastly I want
18:32
to talk about just the same thing again
18:35
kind of just in a different um aspect
18:38
It's custom dashboards in Google Sheets
18:40
And so you can supercharge Google Sheets
18:42
here and essentially turn them into
18:45
custom dashboards where you can automate
18:48
any process that you want So in this
18:50
instance this is for like photo video
18:53
editing So um we have a lot of projects
18:56
coming onto the sheet and we have a
18:58
custom dashboard that we've created and
19:00
we can supercharge sheets like this by
19:02
clicking like adding these buttons on
19:04
here And again like the last example
19:07
anytime we click these buttons we can
19:09
actually cause actions So if I was to
19:11
click this for example I could then all
19:13
of a sudden send off the clients an
19:15
email being like "Hey we've here's your
19:17
editing project We've completed your
19:18
photos We've completed your videos or
19:20
whatever." And then send that off
19:21
immediately to them So you can
19:23
supercharge Google Sheets and um get so
19:25
much additional functionality out of it
19:27
that you didn't know And the cool thing
19:28
about this is there's two parts to this
19:30
Part number one is that you can add
19:32
information onto the Google sheet So you
19:34
can automatically update this Google
19:35
sheet in real time right you can add
19:37
stuff to it You can update those rows
19:39
over time So like for example this
19:41
person could be added and then we could
19:43
actually automatically update them over
19:44
time if we wanted to And then lastly we
19:47
could check a box to start a second
19:48
workflow here where as soon as that box
19:50
is checked we could send emails we could
19:52
send invoices we could do whatever it is
19:55
that we want And so we can really just
19:57
make our own pretty much custom software
19:58
through Google Sheets So anyways I just
20:00
think that's really cool That is it for
20:02
this video Thank you guys so much for
20:04
watching If you want more videos more
20:07
blueprints and more value I'd highly
20:08
recommend taking a look at the school
20:10
community over here Again it's just a
20:11
great place to uh take your automation
20:14
game to the next level learn how to sell
20:15
this kind of stuff or automate your
20:17
entire business Um cool thing is again
20:19
is that not only do you get access to
20:21
all that information but you also have a
20:23
thriving community of like-minded
20:25
individuals where you can learn and grow
20:27
uh with And also you can get access to
20:30
our weekly calls So if you ever uh hit a
20:34
roadblock which sometimes takes like 10
20:36
hours to get over you can just jump on a
20:38
call with me and I'll help you solve the
20:39
problem ASAP So thanks guys so much for
